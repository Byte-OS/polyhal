//! Multi-core Module.
//!
//! This is a leader for the multicore operation
//!
//! You can use this function to use the multicore operation
//!
//! Boot other calls after the multicore
//! If you use this function call, you should call it after arch::init(..);
//! This function will allocate the stack and map it for itself.
//!
//! ```rust
//! Multicore::boot_all();
//! ```
//!
//! Here will have more functionality about multicore in the future.
